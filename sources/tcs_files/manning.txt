roads:

make 0.5m road fraction map (1 or 0). resample with warp to actual fraction.
recalculate fraction to width based on celllength

channels:
-first test without channels, pm04 does not include channel discharge.
-the main channel is short and I don't expect a big difference
- another option is to add channels based on upstream drainage area, for example in potatos etc.
this will make the flow width more realistic, which is much less than the cell width.
- alternative: add oriented roughness to LISEM, which will decrease the flow width, but not increase the ponding?

main channel:
width 50cm
depth 80 cm
angle 45 o
